### charlola.mode (Dracula Themed!)

I loved this hugo theme so much that I needed to add my love of the Dracula Theme to it as well. All credit for the full structure of this Hugo Theme go to https://github.com/charlola.  I used the color palette provided by the official dracula theme site [DraculaThemePalette](https://draculatheme.com/contribute#color-palette)
