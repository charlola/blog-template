Since 2009, I’ve been an independent embedded-software developer, running my own small, one-man software company as my regular job. I design, implement and test software for all kinds of embedded systems, both big and small. Over the years, I’ve developed software in the fields of automotive, medical, home-automation, consumer electronics, agricultural and mobile machinery systems.

I hold a Diplom's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Applied Sciences Cologne, Germany and have a bachelor’s degree in Computer Systems Engineering from the University of Sunderland, UK. You can download my CV for more detailed information.
